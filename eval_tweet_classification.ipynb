    "\n",
    "The evaluation of the LLM's classification of tweets reveals some new insights, while confirming what might be easily observed by simply reviewing the data above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably, the model has a high recall for the `multimedia` class, but this seems due to the fact that it is overly aggressive in classifying tweets as `multimedia`. Specifically, it mistakenly assigns that label to `text` and `both` tweets, leading to a lower precision and F1 score for that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile `text` tweets are classified with high precision, but the model misses some of them, leading to a lower recall score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `both` class is also problematic, with low precision and recall, indicating that the model struggles to classify tweets that contain both text and multimedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these results are not ideal, they do provide a useful baseline for further improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could more carefully examine the tweets that are misclassified and try to identify patterns in the mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could then attempt to improve the system prompt to better account for the nuances of each class, perform some preprocessing on the tweets to make them easier to classify, or apply both techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that LLMs sometimes catch subtle nuances that may not be immediately obvious to a human reviewer. It's quite possible that the LLM's classification is more accurate than the manual labeling in some cases, and can provide a useful starting point for further refinement of the system prompt or other improvements to the classification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's worth noting that the evaluation metrics we calculated are just a starting point. Depending on the specific use case, other metrics such as [Cohen's Kappa](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score.html#sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score) or [Matthews correlation coefficient](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef.html#sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef) could also be useful for evaluating the model's performance."
